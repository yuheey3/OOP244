1. What happens if you try to put your template functions in Data.cpp?
Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain?

If I put my template functions in Data.cpp, it cause error, because the w9_lab.cpp
file include the Data.h file not Data.cpp file, so It can't executed. Moving all
functions to Data.h is also can not execute.

2.Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you 
need to define the template function above main(), before it is used,
or can you define it below main()?

It didn't work. Template function should be in header file.

3.Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your 
functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments?
 What is the advantage of using templates? 

Using templates can avoid duplicate code. I can use this with overloading
 without template, but I need make the same function which are different types. 

4.Are the following equivalent? 
template<class T> 
template<typename T> 

Yes, these two are equivalent. The compiler replaces T with the argument specified by the client code.
