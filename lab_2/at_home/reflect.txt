1. When you increase the size of an existing array of dynamically allocated memory, you need to allocate  new dynamic memory.
It can expand the size of memory, since dynamic memory is for saving memory and load-time. In this workshop, I made ‘pKingdom' first, 
and after I got input from client, I made ‘pKing2’  to increase the size of array. I coped original one to new one, and then deleted 
original one using ‘delete [] pointer’.

2.Kingdom strutter stored the name of the kingdom in an array, but It didn’t need dynamic memory, 
so ‘pointer = new Type [size]’is not used for the name of the array. Keyword ‘new’ and ‘delete’ comes in set usually. 
In this case, delete operator was’t needed, because new operator  wasn’t used.

3 .Compiler determine the definition by function identifier, the parameter types and the order of the parameter types. 
It called Overloaded function. In this workshop, there are two ‘display()..’function which are exactly the same name, 
but parameter are different. When it’s called in main function, compiler see the parameter and find appropriate function.  

4.In this workshop, I’ve learned how to allocate and deallocate dynamic memory for an array of elements 
using new and delete operators. Also I did good practice for using overloaded function.
