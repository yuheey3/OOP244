1)Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before do-ing anything else? 
What could go wrong if the operator doesn’t check for self-assignment?

The copy assignment operator contains the logic for copying data from an existing object 
to an existing object. we compare the address of the current object to the address 
of the source object.  If the addresses match, we skip the assignment logic altogether.  
If we ignore to check for self-assignment, the deallocation statement would release 
the memory holding the resource data and we would lose access to the source resource.

2)List examples of how you avoided code duplication.
To avoid the code duplication, I used isEmpty()function few times.
By calling this function, I didn't need to use the same code to check if the code is
empty or not.

3) In this workshop, I have learned how to define copy constructor and assignment operator.
Also I tried to avoid duplicate code as soon as possible.
