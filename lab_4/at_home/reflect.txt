1.Safe empty state can initialize an object’s instance variables in a constructor. 
In this workshop, when the passenger name and destination is not valid, the name and 
the destination are set to a safe empty state. By doing this, it is ready to receive 
the new variables. ex) theDestination = ‘\0’;
The safe empty state is '\0', while the empty state is noting like 'NULL'.

2.I used 'strcmp' to compare character array, it helped to compare two character array
without using loop. It makes easy to read the code. 
ex) if(strcmp(theDestination, des.theDestination) == 0)

3. When we want to access private data, we can make new function which located in
the inside the class. Inside the class, it can access to private object.  
This is for proctecting from other possible changes.

4. I used strcmp function instead of the strncpy function. When I used this, 
I did 'if(strcmp(theDestination, des.theDestination) == 0)' 
When theDestination and the des.Destination are the same, it retuens 0.

5.In this workshop, I have learned how to define a constructor that initializes 
an object's data. Also the conception of the safe empty state. 
urthermore, I practiced making overloading as well.

Quiz 3 Reflection

1.What is the difference between a class and object?
*Mistake
-I didn't describe the concept of object.
*Answer 
-The object is an intance of a class, while class is used to attach data and
its associated functions together, it is similer to structure in C language.

5.When is a destructure invoked?
*Mistake
-I couldn't explain what is the destructure exactly.
*Answer
-When a stack variable goes out of scope, its destructor is called.
