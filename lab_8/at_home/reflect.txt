1.What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?

An abstract class is one that has one or more pure virtual functions.
while concrete class has no pure virtuals, also can be used to create an object.
An abstract class  provides no implementation(s) for its pure virtual functions, 
the compiler cannot instantiate the class.


2.Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?

I used derived classes to inherits iAccount. In this workshop, Account.h inherits iAccount.h,also
ChequingAccount.h and SavingsAccount.h both inherits Account.h. 

iAccount* CreateAccount(const char*, double); I used this function at Allocator.cpp.


3.Explain what have you learned in this workshop.

In this workshop, Ihave lerned how to define a pure virtual function.
TO do that, I used 'virtual' keyword. ex) virtual bool credit(double) = 0;.
Also I lerned how is work an abstract base class. This workshop was good practice for
making inherit class as well.
