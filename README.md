## Subject Description
This subject introduces the student to object-oriented programming.
The student learns to build reusable objects, encapsulate data and logic within a class, 
inherit one class from another and implement polymorphism.  This subject uses the C++ programming 
language exclusively and establishes a foundation for learning system analysis and design 
and more advanced concepts as implemented in languages such as C++, Java, C# and Objective-C.  
  
  
 ### Learning Outcomes:
1. Design classes with dynamically allocated resources to model the components of a programming solution
2. Design member functions using logic constructs to solve tasks of linear complexity
3 .Relate classes using inheritance hierarchies to minimize the duplication of object code
4. Design polymorphic objects to amplify the reusability of program code
5. Use stream objects to interact with users and access persistent data
6. Trace the execution of object-oriented code to validate its correctness
7. Code a complete program using polymorphic objects to solve a systems or business problem
8. Explain the purpose of an object-oriented programming feature to inform a business person
